## Before start

### OS roles

- Referee:
    - Manages protection, isolation, and sharing of resources
    - Makes developer's life easier
- Illusionist:
    - Provides an abstract interface to the hardware, who thinks that it is the only program and has all the resources
- Glue:
    - Programs connected to each other with network sockets, shared memory, etc.

### Moore's Law (is ended)

There is a huge gap between memory demands and single-chip memory capacity.

Models grow 340x every 18 months(GPT1 -> BERT -> GPT-2 -> GPT-3 -> ...), but GPU only grows 1.7x every 18 months.
